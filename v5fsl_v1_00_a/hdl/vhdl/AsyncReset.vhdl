-- Transforms an asynchronous reset signal into a synchronous one.
--
-- When ASYNC_RST_I is asserted, RST_O is also asynchronously asserted. Once
-- ASYNC_RST_I has been deasserted, RST_O is deasserted synchronous to CLK_I.
--
-- If param_FALLING_EDGE is set, RST_O is deasserted on the falling edge of
-- CLK_I. Otherwise, RST_O is deasserted on the CLK_I's rising edge.
--
-- ASYNC_RST_I deassertion to RST_O deassertion is 0.5 to 1 clock cycles.
--
-- Example:
--
-- ASYNC_RST_I  _______/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\____________________________
-- CLK_I        ____/~~~~\____/~~~~\____/~~~~\____/~~~~\____/~~~~\_____
-- RST_O        _______/~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\___________________
